  <H1>OUT OF STOCK: <br> Diversity in the Stock Image Industry </H1>

    <b>With the growth of online advertising and social media, the requirements for stock photos have also grown.</b> We now have massive online libraries full of images for every specified category and content - like porn, I guess, but for marketing companies. They also have a reputation of being clichéd; some of the most iconic stock imagery includes the stiffly smiling office worker ‘Brad’ pretending to type, and basic Becky stood on top of a mountain at sunset, with her arms spread to show her adventurous spirit.
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class="imageAndCaption">
    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/Brad.png" alt=""> </div>
    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/Becky.png" alt=""> </div>
    <p class="imageCaption"> Amusingly, I found these images <b>AFTER</b> typing the description in my first paragraph. I literally typed 'man at desk' and 'woman on mountain' and they came straight up. <i>That</i> is how much of a cliché they are.</p>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  What you will notice these two images have in common, other than the fact you cringed at both, is that they are white, western, attractive, thin, definitely-not-poor and seemingly able-bodied people. Lucky Brad and Becky - not only did they get paid to pose for these lovely snaps, they are also some of the most privileged people in the world!
  <br>
  <br>
  Just to be clear, I don’t mean ‘lucky’ as in serendipitous luck. Being in this demographic is <b><i>the reason why</i></b> they grew up to be stock image models, it’s literally the job criteria, no coincidence there at all. See below some evidence:
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class="imageAndCaption">
    <h2> Search results for "Office worker Stock Image" </h2>
    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/Officeworkerscrenshot.png" alt=""> </div>
    <br>
    <h2> Search results for "Boss Stock Image" </h2>
    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/BossStockImageScreenshot.png" alt=""> </div>
    <br>
    <h2> Search results for "Successful Stock Image" </h2>
    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/Successfulscreenshot.png" alt=""> </div>
  </div>

  <br>
  <br>
  Stock image companies make up a $4 Billion industry supplying the world with over 350 million different stock photos. The images are seen everywhere. So what impact does this have when the people represented are mostly White & <i>*insert all the other privileges mentioned above*</i>?
  <br>
  Stock images are chosen by brands because the subject in the image reflects a company value or a target audience. Leaving out entire groups of people from that, sends the message that they do not value you as an audience; doing so on such a large scale perpetuates oppression. The frequent appearances of people like Brad and Becky parades biases in front of us all, for our subconscious minds to absorb and internalize.
   <br>
   <br>
   The absence of women and people of colour in a Google search for ‘Office stock images’ reflects the absence of women or POC in that role in real life. It’s a textbook case of the chicken and egg conundrum; and just like the chicken, it doesn’t matter what came first because it is still perpetuating a cycle...
   <br>
   <br>
   <div class="imageAndCaption">
    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/Stockdiversitymeme.png" alt=""> </div>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  This lack of representation directly feeds into the difficulties that marginalised groups have accessing positions of power and safe professional spaces. A search for ‘Boss stock images’ returns no women at all. 70% of teenage girls say that magazine representations of women impact their self esteem; and if these are the types of stock-photos that pepper our daily meals of media consumption - it will be doing the same damage.
<br>
<br>
Two years ago when I was working alongside some female Virtual Reality developers, it came to light that one of the main stock-image companies (who I don’t think I should mention but you can probably guess) had a very strange idea of what a ‘Woman in VR’ looked like. The men in VR, featured in front of ‘sciencey’ backgrounds, looked inspiringly futuristic; though the shots of women were completely oversexualised and setting some bizarrely unrealistic expectations (see below). Luckily, change has since happened. I am happy to say the front page of ‘Women in VR stock photos’ now exhibits no cleavage.
<br>

    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/WomeninVRstockimages.png" alt=""> </div>
    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/womeninvRstockimage2.jpg" alt=""> </div>
  </div>
  <br>
<br>
See what i mean..?
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1> <b>Change is happening</b></h1>
<br>
<br>
So yes, change. <br>
It’s happening, thank god. 
<br>
<br>
The content we are fed is diversifying and we are even pushing past tokenistic and grossly commercialised campaigns like ‘body positivity’ (If you don’t know why that movement was a total farce it’s worth doing some research or feel free to contact me for a chat) toward actual representation. 
<br>
<br>
A few companies are doing just that (I will link them at the end) <br>
I’m not just talking about different ethnicity models and female office workers. Nope. I’m talking every texture, flavour, and shape of human there is. Doing normal stock image stuff like holding an empty mug, or high fiving. Just being. Just existing.
<br>
<br>
You don’t have to type ‘disabled’ in front of the subject you want to see a stock image with a disabled person featured. ‘Office worker’ isn’t a synonym for ‘White’. And every single skin colour is present. It’s quite utopian actually.
<br>
<br>
For an industry that was invented to help under-privileged people access professional quality images, it has become a highly unprofessional festering abscess of privilege.

  <h2>DIVERSE STOCK IMAGE LIBRARIES</h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://broadlygenderphotos.vice.com/"> The Gender Spectrum Collection:
    Stock Photos Beyond the Binary </a> is a stock photo library featuring images of trans and non-binary models that go beyond the clichés. This collection aims not to define them as their gender identities though — but people with careers, relationships, talents, passions, and home lives.
  <br>
  <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/nonbinarystockexample.jpg" alt=""> </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.nappy.co">Nappy.co </a> is a collection of FREE stock photos of Black and Brown people. Nappy’s website is beautifully made, and very easy to find what you're looking for as the search option lets you get super-specific. The photos themselves are also very beautiful.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://tonl.co"> TONL </a> is one of my favourites due to their beautifully shot images and commitment to diversity in every way. It feels like a perfect reflection of real life. If i'm honest, I could just browse their site like I would browse a photographer's portfolio. Their photos are $25 but you can get a monthly subscription from $29 allowing you to download at least 15 images per month depending on your subscription level.
  <br>
  <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/TONLstockimages.png" alt=""> </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.disabilityimages.com"> Disability Images </a> is an entire library dedicated to images that feature disabled people. I think it's an amazing resource and hope that it gets used in all the usual contexts when disability is not the focus, as these images are about so much more than just disabilities.
