   CREATING A NEW TYPE OF USER INTERFACE 
    <br>
    <br>
  </p>
    <p>
      User Interface is the part of a design that allows you to interact and communicate with a computer. 
      Whether this is the touchscreen on your phone, a mouse and keyboard, or a TV remote; they are the 
      golden gateway to being able to use and understand our technology. 
      <br>
      <br>
      These examples I've just given are common household objects designed by tech companies with an interface 
      that enables you to use their product. <i>(They are not always successful in designing these with the user in mind. 
      I mean, can you honestly tell me what every button on your TV remote does?)</i>
      <br>
      <br>
      But the UI design is indeed the key to their success. Do you remember the old iPods with the scroll wheel? 
      This famously innovative design seems so simple and user friendly. The tech behind it is of course the complete 
      opposite - but Apple were able to create an interface which is both intuitive and gives the user a great deal of 
      control over the technology, which is why the product was so successful and ultimately led to soaring sales of 
      portable MP3 devices.
    <br>
    <br>
    <p class="specialText"><i>“Design is the intermediary between information and understanding”</i> - Hans Hoffman.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    Accessing music digitally is something which will always require an especially well designed interface. Why? Because it compiles huge libraries of data with a user that wants to access precisely what they want in an instant; even if they don’t actually know what they want. By this, I mean using genre playlists, artist collections,Apple Genius, Spotify Radio, Youtube Reccommended … the list goes on. 
<br>
<br>
The user doesn’t want to spend too much time or thought on choosing what to play, that just wouldn’t be enjoyable (unlike choosing a film, or taking a photo), but it has to suit their mood and situation which, of course, the machine cannot (yet) read. Indeed users may have a little more patience with a digital directory in comparison to a physical collection of vinyl LPs that need to be carefully loaded onto a record player - but the problematic act choosing ‘the right song’ proves a lot harder when you’re looking at a list of names rather than an alphabetized wall of expressive album artwork.
<br>
<br>
But <i>most</i> users are expecting the speed of their song selection to match the speed of digital content consumption through social media: instant. The rise of streaming platforms such as Spotify has provided a tonic to this first world struggle in the form of pre-existing playlists and their serendipitous ‘Spotify Radio’ - but it’s still a lot of clicking. 
<br>
<br>
We (my partner on this project Lana Periric & I) wanted to create a simple interface for these Spotify Playlists that could be controlled by the user quickly and based on their mood. A ‘mood reader’, originally (some kind of camera/facial recognition?), which we then developed into a ‘mood selector’ to avoid issues with inaccuracy (there’s an angry option and, naturally, we wouldn’t want to exacerbate the pre-existing emotion by making them stare at themselves in a camera whilst Spotify plays Three Little birds).
    <br>
    <br>
    This interface would then tell Spotify to play a playlist for your selected mood, in a random shuffled order. This takes out the chore of having to mentally trawl through your entire knowledge of music trying to pick the right song (can be a bit awkward when someone hands you the aux and your mind suddenly goes completely blank) at the same time as allowing you to discover new music.

How does Deeji differ from Alexa? Other than the use of different streaming platforms (Deeji uses Spotify or iTunes regardless of being a premium user, Alexa uses Amazon Music) When Alexa was tested with the same task - saying “Alexa i’m feeling happy, play some music” received a response of “that’s good to hear”. When asked a second time she played a Disney soundtrack playlist. I could leave it on that note - but i’ve got more.
<br>
<br>
When asked to play a sad song, a playlist of ‘melancholy classical’ played. Okay technically it is fitting, but when we are sad we generally don’t want to listen to classical … We want boy bands with haircuts, singing something we know all the words to so we can look out the window and pretend we’re in a movie.

    <br>
    <br>
    The reason Deeji trumps all of this, is because the playlists are crowdsourced compilations of music that has made real people feel these emotions. Not ones Alexa’s poorly programmed internal DJ guessed would be relevant. Our Deeji playlists can be constantly added to, to hear new songs and tracks too.
    <br>

    <p class="specialText"><b>WHAT IS THE FUTURE OF DEEJI?</b></p>
    <br>
    <br>
    The beauty of this interface is that the entire thing <i>could</i> be recreated using paper & card using the same conductive paint, for a more sustainable and accessible design.
    <br>
    <br>

      <p class="imageCaption">This is the 'circuit' created with conductive paint, ready to be fitted into the housing </p>
    </div>
    <br>
    <br>
    Although paper is still widely used, it has changed completely throughout the digital age and has been replaced by a more popular way to view images and words: no other than the screen.
    Using paper itself <i>as</i> a 'screen', folds this back unto itself. It reappropriates an analogue material into something digital and interactive. The benefits of a paper interface are actually vast - for example, it can be interchangeable, recyclable, and modifiable.
    <br>
    <br>
    In the spirit of crowdsourcing, much like our playlists which are available for anyone to add to and listen to (you don’t need Deeji - I will link them below), and D.I.Y. interfaces; <i>the future of Deeji</i> is an online downloadable/printable net (plan) for the housing design and an open source max patch with assembly instructions for the wires. The whole thing would probably cost about £25 to buy all of the parts.
    <br>
    <br>
    Designing low-fi interfaces to do the job of something like Alexa is hugely rebellious in a capitalist throwaway society that leads us to believe everything must be bought and never re-used or fixed; and the unwritten rules of sharing is a perfect embodiment of the power of knowledge in this modern world where technology is so freely accessible and open source.
