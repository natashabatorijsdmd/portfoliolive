   PROMOTIONAL ANIMATION FOR 
   <br>
   <BR> PLYMOUTH BOAT TRIPS & IMPACT LAB
    <br>
   <br> (First full animation on After Effects)
    <br>

      Plymouth Boat Trips is doing their part for the climate crisis by trailblazing the way for zero-emission electric-powered boats. They are testing Plymouth's first electric boat to see how it will work with the charging ports, engineering, and public usage. This boat will be a foot ferry which takes passengers to and from Mt. Edgcumbe in Cornwall.
      <br>
      <br>
      Electric engines on boats actually existed between 1890 and 1920 before combustion engines came along and outgrew them in popularity. The electric engine is far superior when measured against the combustion engine in terms of green-ness, noise pollution, and passenger experience.
<br>
<br> 
Plymouth Boat Trips set out to trial the first boat - following the success of that, they will fit their whole fleet with electric engines. Then, once the harbour has better facilities for charging and docking, encourage the other boats in the 7 Plymouth marinas to do the same.

The brief, set by The Impact Lab, asked us to make a promotional video highlighting the plan and the benefits for families and passengers.
<br>
<br>
It was important to me that it was simple, friendly, and exciting with lots of colour and movement and minimal text. Inspired by the Stuxnet documentary I created the assets in illustrator and the animation in After Effects. As my first time doing a full length animation on After effects, with a short time to complete the brief, i kept it 2D, although I would have like to work in 3D had i had access to Unity (coronavirus lockdown meant working from home and so no access to Unity Software!)
