      <b>I was absolutely delighted by </b> the addition of a ‘blood droplet’ to the emoji vocab a year ago, and even now, it gets quite a lot of use (albeit mostly in my girls’ group chat). Whether you use it or not - the fact that it exists is evidential that the taboo around periods is becoming *yawn* outdated, and 50% of the world menstruating shouldn’t be a massive secret.
  <br>
  <br>
  If we say as a blanket statement that <b>periods come with problems</b>, and we say that the tech industry is largely about finding solutions: It seems obvious that there would be a demand for smart solutions for bleeders. ‘Half of us’ is quite a large market, after all and the only surprising thing is that it has taken this long.
  <br>
  <br>
  In fact, it is well overdue that a trillion dollar industry dominated by white and well-educated men puts some welly into the development of anything that closes privilege gaps. (At this point I’m choosing to ignore the fact that they’re actually profiting off our monthly cycle of blood and pain, because I want the products being made, I want to see them on shelves, and I need them in my life.) And just to make it super clear, not having a period is a massive privilege. <i>Think... Sick days, £££ spent on products, ruined clothes, hormone imbalances, cravings, missed meetings, missed exercise, missed networking opportunities etc. </i>
  <br>

  I’ve struggled with severe PMS symptoms for the last few years. The pain is usually so bad I am bed-bound, vomiting, and crying into my gift-size box of ferrero-rocher. I also experience neurological symptoms such as short term memory loss and aphasia (not processing words whilst you hear, and not recognising faces -  you may call this a ‘brain fog’ or ‘brain fatigue’) which a lot of people get during the bleeding part of their cycle… and as you can imagine it makes most tasks a lot harder!
  <br>
  <br>
  I’ve been to the doctor and apart from offering me an actual HYSTERECTOMY (not joking!!!) I was not offered any suggestions on how to improve these symptoms. Around this time I realised that there is much more than just a blood emoji, there is actually a myriad of cutting-edge smart products under the term 'Femtech'.
  <i>(As much as i love the emoji, it it’s not going to help when i’m in the queue for tesco with my 4 tubs of Ben & Jerry’s doing ‘the dance’ to try and style out my cramps)</i>

  <p class="subheading"><b>1. MOODY MONTH & FLO</b></h3> </p>
  <br>
  <h3> “THERE’S AN APP FOR THAT” </h3>
  <p>

    <div class="blogImage"><img src="./assets/blogImages/moodyapp.png" alt=""> </div>

  </div>
  <br>

  These are the two best period tracker apps on the market. But they do so much more than just track your cycle. I’m looking at these from the perspective of an interface designer AND a bleeder - and they’re a 10 out of 10 for both. I would go as far as to say they made me enjoy having a menstrual cycle (yes really).
  <br>
  <br>
  <b> Month, available only on the Apple Store, has got a superbly designed interface with beautiful graphics. Designed and developed only by people who bleed. </b> I first learnt about the app after listening to the <a href="https://podbay.fm/p/adulting/e/1551016519">“It’s good to be moody” episode of Adulting Podcast with Moody’s founder Amy Thompson.</a> Hearing her talk about the process of specifically recruiting Female App Developers, so that people with periods were at the heart of it (and profiting from it) actually inspired me massively on my own journey as a developer - but that’s a story for another post. It has incredible detailed symptom logging features, allowing you to track all of your moods throughout the month to look for patterns (including the 'brain fog' i mentioned earlier) as opposed to just the menstruation cycle. They also sell supplements and vitamins to go with the app's personalised reccommendations - making it super easy to access them and learn what your body needs.
  <br>
  <br>
  Unfortunately, because I am a (proud/stubborn) Android Mobile user I was not able to download it and use the app in the way i wanted (I still had it on my iPad so i could explore all the features). <b>Fortunately, Flo was there to help, with almost all the same features and tracking capabilities. I love Flo’s podcast section about menstrual health, and its stories that help with sleeping and anxiety.</b>
  <br>
  <br>
  <b><i>Here is a bit about both apps:</i></b>
  <br>
  <br>

  <section class="reviewList">

  <h2> HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You enter in your menstruation dates and the app uses Artificial-Intelligence to predict your future cycles.</li>
  <li> You enter in other symptoms (achey boobs, discharge consistency, cravings, sleep quality etc.) and it uses these to improve it’s predictions and also help you track your moods</li>
  <li>The app then suggests things that can help with your symptoms. E.g. stretches to ease pain, recorded stories to help with insomnia, articles on nutrition, etc.</li>
</ul>  

<h2>FEATURES</h2>

<ul>

  <li>Notifications to make sure you don’t forget to put in your cycle dates and symptoms. The one that says ‘Have you started your period today?’ normally precedes me running to the loo and going ‘ah sh*t, i forgot a tampon’. </li>
  <li> Fertility tracker - Lets you know when you’re most likely going to become pregnant.</li>
  <li>Food and exercise suggestions tailor made to the specific day of your cycle.</li>
  <li>Moody month has personalised supplement and vitamin suggestions with an easy way to order them directly from the app</li>
  <li>Sexual health tips</li>
  <li>Graphs and reports to see your menstrual health from a ‘birds eye view’. Want to see every cycle from the past year? No problem.</li>
  <li>Podcasts and audio experiences - to help with learning more about menstrual health and also to help you sleep.</li>
  <li>‘Cramp relief roadmap’ (on Flo) and ‘Period Hacks’ on both apps.</li>
  <li>Discharge analysis</li>
</ul> 
  
<h2> BENEFITS </h2>

  <ul>
<li> A much wider understanding of how your cycle affects you, both in your body and mind. It will improve your physical health and mental health.</li>
<li>Take control of how your period affects your job and personal life. You can book in that very important meeting for Ovulation time, when you’re most likely to ace it. Rather than it landing on brain fog day.</li>
<li>Ever been grouchy as hell and craving an obscure dessert from your childhood but not known why? And then gone to the toilet, seen the blood, and gone ‘ah thats why I was being an a**hole.’? Never again will it sneak up on you like that because the app will tell you that you’re supposed to be feeling a bit yucky.</li>
<li><b>Less ruined knickers.</b></li>
<li>Easier to conceive when you decide to start trying for a baby (more accurate readings offer more precise windows of when it is best to try)</li>
</ul>

 <h2> COST </h2>

 <ul>
  <li>Both apps are free.</li>
  <li>Flo offers a premium account at <b>£9.49 per month</b>, or <b>£38.49 per year</b> which is a total bargain as it works out as <b>£3.21 per month</b></li>
</ul>

<p class="subheading"><b>2. LIVIA</b></h3> </p>
<br>
<h3> “I FEEL TENS TIMES BETTER” </h3>
<br>
<br>

   <br>
   <br>
  This one is a little more pricey, but totally worth it. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a method of pain relief involving the use of a mild electrical current. That sounds really scary and at first I thought I was going to be electrocuted (well you kind of are, though not how you imagine it), but it actually feels pretty nice. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Livia is a pocket sized, wearable tens machine. They market themselves as the ‘Off Switch’ for period pains, and I can confirm this to be an accurate description. Offering immediate pain relief, this dinky little gadget is literally my best friend on days when my ovaries are giving me their best ‘Jaws 2’ impression. Traditional Tens machines are used on women in labour to help with the paind of giving birth - although Livia say that the electric pulses on their product are actually different and have been specifically designed to alleviate menstrual cramps.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>

  <section class="reviewList">

 <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2> 
 <ul>
<li>The technology behind Livia is based on the “Gate Control Theory” and works by transmitting a very unique pulse to keep the nerves “busy.” When the nerves are stimulated, the nerve gate is closed, preventing pain signals from reaching the brain and being felt.</li>
 </ul>
  
  <h2>FEATURES</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Small enough to go in your back pocket or clip onto your waistband</li>
  <li>Sticky pads that you place where you have pain</li> 
  <li>To change intensity of the pulses </li> 
  <li>A cute case to carry it in.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>BENEFITS</h2>
<ul>
<li>Instant pain relief </li>
<li>No drugs necessary</li>
</ul>
  
<h2>COST</h2>
<ul>
<li>Between £125 - £199</li>
</ul>

<h3> “PUMPED CUP KICKS” </h3>

  This one is super cool. I'm talking futuristic cyborg period vibes.
  <br>
  <br>
  You’ve probably heard of a Moon Cup. Well the Loon cup is the worlds first smart menstrual cup. It allows you to get health information from your period (from the actual blood!) whilst also, very importantly, telling you (via phone or smart watch) how full it is - so there’s no more overflow accidents. SERIOUSLY… WOW.
  <br>
  <br>
  Loon Cup syncs with your phone over Bluetooth. The cup tracks flow and records changes in menstrual color and body temperature, giving you an insight into your health. Up until now, there has been no way of accurately measuring how heavy your period is and understanding what it means for you. Loon Cup believe that your blood holds vital information about your health, and that we are ‘throwing away’ this information every time we chuck a sanitary towel or empty our cups.
  <br>
  <br>

<section class="reviewList">

 <h2>HOW IT WORKS</h2>
  
 <ul>
<li>Embedded triaxial, RGB and force sensors to measure the fullness of the cup, colour of the blood, temperature etc </li>
  <li>Bluetooth receiver to connect to your phone.</li>
 <li>A teeny tiny battery to keep it powered</li> 
  <li>Encased in silicone to protect the electrical compnents from coming into contact with your body</li>
 </ul>
  
  <h2>FEATURES</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Track volume of blood to see your hourly pattern or identify abnormalities</li>
<li>App feature to compare your periods to each other</li>
<li>Detection of tiny changes in the colour</li>
<li> Cycle tracking</li>
<li>Basal body temperature tracking and recording</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>BENEFITS</h2>
  <ul>
<li>Accurate health information about your periods</li>
<li>It can predict when you will be your heaviest</li>
<li>Spot gynecological issues early on</li>
<li>No overflows from the cup</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>COST</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>$50 + $20 Shipping from the US</li>

<p class="subheading"><b>4. PERIOD PANTS</b></h3> </p>
<br>
<h3> “NOT DIGITAL - BUT STILL HI-TECH” </h3>
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class="imageAndCaption">

  <br>
  <br>

  <p>Okay this is my favourite thing ever. I love my pants so much they get their own special draw. And they get a place on this article which was just going to be for digital technology.
  <br>
  <br>
  Period Underwear works using layers of hi-tech materials to collect the blood (mine collect 4 tampons worth of blood - I can work on my feet all day long on my heaviest day with no worries whatsoever), and have no stain, no smell, and no wetness.
  <br>
  <br>
  They are supposed to last a few years worth of periods. I have a few pairs and mix them up usually using my favourites first (when my period is heaviest) Although it may seem expensive, over the years, it is a much cheaper option than tampons and pads - and so much better for the environment.
  <br>
  <br>
  It’s basically like you’re not bleeding at all. Which is why you must be thinking that this surely cant be real… well I am here to tell you that this is 2020 and we have finally overcome the mess, and faff, of blood pouring out of us every month!
  <br>
  <br>
  So why not just get a mooncup? I actually don’t like moon cups very much. I find them a tad ‘invasive’, fairly messy, and generally just annoying to deal with. My girlfriends don’t agree and claim their cup changed their life, but nonetheless have gone and bought a pair of these pants at my orders because they’re GREAT for mooncup overflows, or if you want a lazy sofa day of feeling like you’re free-bleeding. And you can wear them to bed so no bed-sheet spillages.
  <br>
  <br>
  Several different companies do them but i can recommend:
  <br>
  <br>
  
<section class="reviewList">
  <h2>ONES I USE</h2>
  <a href="https://www.shethinx.com"> Thinx </a> (last the longest on my heaviest days. Except sizing is weird so go a size bigger than usual) Also check out their super inclusive branding and <i>beautiful</i> packaging.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://www.modibodi.co.uk">Modibodi </a>(These look and feel amazing on and can hold up on my heaviest days too!) And they have the best range of different shapes and styles.
  <br>
  <br>
 <h2> ONES TO TRY </h2>
  <a href="https://www.dearkates.com"> Dear Kate </a>- actually have their own patent because the ‘Underlux’ technology is supposedly different to the others. Dry all day long. Even on your heaviest. Also super sustainable and diverse branding.
  <br>
  <br>
  <a href="https://wuka.co.uk"> WUKA </a> - (Currently in the post about to arrive as a present to myself!) The reviews on these are amazing and what I love is that the heavy flow pants (hold 4 tampons worth of blood) look comfortable and sexy.
